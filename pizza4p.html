        <h6>Project Overview</h6>
        <p>This is an attempt to reimagine the famous pizza restaurant chain in Vietnam - Pizza 4P's. As a frequent customer I knew that the restaurant lack an online, user-centered service. This prompted me to do some research dedicated to create a specialized app and website that allow users to make online order and table reservation.</p>

          <p>Pizza lovers lack the time to go to the restaurant. Sometimes when they do, restaurants are crowded and mostly occupied, Customers also just can't tell that it is crowded beforehand.</p>

        <h6>User research summary</h6>
        <p>The methodology I used was qualitative. I conducted interviews to understand the users I'm designing for and their needs. There are 2 primary user groups identified through research.
        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; One was working adults who don't have time to cook. Others are frequent customers at the Pizza 4P's.
        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; The later user group confirmed initial assumptions about Pizza 4P's customers, but research also revealed that there are more problems included interests and challenges that make it difficult to get a table at the restaurants in-person.</p>

        <p>I conducted a round of usability study on my first wireframe, which helped guide the designs to complete mockups.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Round 1 Findings:</b>
          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users want to specify their seat preferences
          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plus icons on the list item have no extra functionalities

        <h6>Refining the Design</h6>
        <p>After the first study I decided to remove the restaurant indicator. That information is irrelevant for the online ordering. I also add coupons and favourite buttons on top as it provides a nice addition to the experience.</p>
        <img src="assets/pizza4p/refining.png" height="auto">
        <p>I actually did another round of usability study, but this took place after I finish my mockups (don't panic I will show you my full mockup soon). After the second usability study I found out that sometimes (even though the chances are small), people coming in the diner in a group bigger than 8. The number of guests also affect the time slot, so I re-order the guest picker and change it a number input. I also found that I did not have accessibility in mind during the first iteration, show I made up for that in my refined designs.</p>

        <h6>Website Mockups</h6>
        <p>I approach the design with a Mobile-first process, as I believed that the majority of users prefer to use their phone when making orders and table reservation. However I cannot exclude, for example, the desk workers who do most of their task on the computer, or people who are one-time users that do not feel the need to download the 4P app. We need to make a corresponding website. For the web design process I follow the same framework: <b>Identifying problems, making wireframe and conducting usability studies, and finalizing a complete mockups.</b></p>

        <h6>Accessibility Considerations</h6>
        <p>I did considered accessibility in my design. It's actually the first time I ever did, and I'm happy that I did this research, because one of the most important thing in user-centered design is, like its name, design a product that is for the people, a product that can be used by every type of people.</p>
        <p>Accessibility considerations:
          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding alt text for screen reader
          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add change language option (English and Vietnamese)
          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add options for disability chairs/kid charis when making table reservation (which I did reflect in my design, yay!)</p>

        <h6>Takeaways</h6>
        <p>I learned a lot how keeping the users front and center when making design decisions is beneficial right from the start. Most of the time when you think of solutions for a smaller group of people, the solution will branch out and end up helping every users.</p>
